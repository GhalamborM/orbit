 *
 * A pushable source emits the following events:
 *
 * - `beforePush` - emitted prior to the processing of `push`, this event
 * includes the requested `Transform` as an argument.
 *
 * - `push` - emitted after a `push` has successfully been applied, this event's
 * arguments include both the requested `Transform` and an array of the actual
 * applied `Transform` instances.
 *
 * - `pushFail` - emitted when an error has occurred pushing a transform, this
 * event's arguments include both the requested `Transform` and the error.
 *
 * A pushable source must implement a private method `_push`, which performs
 * the processing required for `push` and returns a promise that resolves to an
 * array of `Transform` instances.
